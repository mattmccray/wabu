# Todo

- mkdirs -p on target path
- If X.coffee isn't found, try X.js (or less/css, case depending)
- Don't compile required .js files (enclose with backticks?)
- Support some sort of #!require folder/* (or just folder/ ?)
- Prevent recursive includes
- Use UglifyJS for compression
- Add support for shebang lines
- Add support for non-wrapped CoffeeScript output
